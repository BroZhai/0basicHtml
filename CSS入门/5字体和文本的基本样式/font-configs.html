    <h3>聪明大冰精</h3>
    <p class="baka1">
        Cirno is an ice fairy. While she is described as a weak boss in the Touhou series, her powers are not to be underestimated, and that is implied to be so in Phantasmagoria of Flower View by Eiki Shiki. Her personality is childish and rather incompetent, as you might expect from her appearance. <br>【Franklin Gothic Medium字体】
    </p>
    <p id="cirno">
        During the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she attacked the player, who was just passing by, likely to test her strength. <br>【字体"描边"设置为:light】
    </p>
    <p>
        In Perfect Cherry Blossom, she returned as the midboss of stage 1, presumably to challenge the player character again to prove her strength. <br> 【字体"颜色"为蓝】
